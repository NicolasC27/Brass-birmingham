# Map art pipeline

The era backgrounds in `app/public` are composed, not hand-painted:

1. `geo.ts` exports the board geometry (routes, towns, merchants) to JSON.
   Bundle and run it from `app/`:
   `./node_modules/.bin/esbuild ../tools/map/geo.ts --bundle --platform=node --format=esm --alias:@=./src --outfile=/tmp/geo.mjs && node /tmp/geo.mjs /tmp/geo.json`
2. `bg-control2.mjs` draws control sheets for image models (`edges`, `lines`, `overlay`).
3. `fal-run.mjs` submits a request to a fal.ai endpoint (key read from `.env.local`, `FAL_KEY=...`) and downloads the result.
   The terrain currently in use came from `fal-ai/nano-banana` with a strict top-down prompt, upscaled ×3 by `fal-ai/clarity-upscaler`.
4. `bg-compose.mjs` takes a top-down terrain painting and engraves the canal beds, survey lines, village grounds and merchant basins from the real geometry, with a 15 % bleed on every side. It writes both the canal painting and the rail-era grade.

Scripts need Playwright's Chromium (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` pointing at a browsers folder) and ImageMagick for previews.

## Rail era, painted

The rail-era background is no longer a grade of the canal painting: it is a
Midjourney painting of the same land under industry (source kept as
`tools/assets/map/map-era-rail-midjourney.jpg`), composed into the canal
map's frame by `tools/assets/map/compose-rail.sh <painting> <geo.json>`:
scaled to cover the world, 15 % mirrored bleed, soft embankments along the
rail routes, mist in the far edges, served as WebP.
